INFERENCERS
-----------
Haskell source code for implementations of various inferencers in
haskell-implementations/
with the appropriate folder names
greedy/
hindley-milner/
b&k2011variant/



PROTOTYPES
----------
Java source for the algorithm prototypes is in 
java-algorithms/src

src/graph/Algorithm.java  as base class for algorithms
          Algorithm_ForwardBackward_RepeatPropagation.java for Algorithm 1
	  Algorithm_ByRepresentativeVertex.java for Algorithm 2

          Graph.java  			graph G
          ComponentGraph.java		graph H, R

src/timeconstraints/ contains time constraint generation code

Java code, as a prototype, was not compiled to an executable - doesn't have a usable entry point.
